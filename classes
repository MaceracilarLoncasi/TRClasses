If your Dungeon Master uses the <a title=\"rules on firearms\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/dungeon-masters-workshop#Firearms\">rules on firearms</a> in the <em><a title=\"Dungeon Master’s Guide\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg\">Dungeon Master’s Guide</a></em> and your artificer has been exposed to the operation of such weapons, your artificer is proficient with them.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>@Compendium[world.ddb-tengria-ddb-class-features.78vzbsN5tCUKf0lp]{Magical Tinkering}</b></p>\n<p>At 1st level, you learn how to invest a spark of magic into mundane objects. To use this ability, you must have thieves’ tools or artisan’s tools in hand. You then touch a Tiny nonmagical object as an action and give it one of the following magical properties of your choice:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The object sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.</li>\n<li>Whenever tapped by a creature, the object emits a recorded message that can be heard up to 10 feet away. You utter the message when you bestow this property on the object, and the recording can be no more than 6 seconds long.</li>\n<li>The object continuously emits your choice of an odor or a nonverbal sound (wind, waves, chirping, or the like). The chosen phenomenon is perceivable up to 10 feet away.</li>\n<li>A static visual effect appears on one of the object’s surfaces. This effect can be a picture, up to 25 words of text, lines and shapes, or a mixture of these elements, as you like.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The chosen property lasts indefinitely. As an action, you can touch the object and end the property early.</p>\n<p>You can bestow magic on multiple objects, touching one object each time you use this feature, though a single object can only bear one property at a time. The maximum number of objects you can affect with this feature at one time is equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one object). If you try to exceed your maximum, the oldest property immediately ends, and then the new property applies.</p>\n\n<p><b>@Compendium[world.ddb-tengria-ddb-class-features.dJF1HEPWpxK29E9x]{Spellcasting}</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You’ve studied the workings of magic and how to cast spells, channeling the magic through objects. To observers, you don’t appear to be casting spells in a conventional way; you appear to produce wonders from mundane items and outlandish inventions.</p>\n<h5 id=\"ToolsRequired\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Tools Required</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You produce your artificer spell effects through your tools. You must have a spellcasting focus—specifically thieves’ tools or some kind of artisan’s tool—in hand when you cast any spell with this Spellcasting feature (meaning the spell has an ‘M’ component when you cast it). You must be proficient with the tool to use it in this way. See chapter 5, “<a title=\"Equipment\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/equipment\">Equipment</a>,” in the <em><a title=\"Player’s Handbook\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb\">Player’s Handbook</a></em> for descriptions of these tools.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">After you gain the Infuse Item feature at 2nd level, you can also use any item bearing one of your infusions as a spellcasting focus.</p>\n<h5 id=\"Cantrips0LevelSpells\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Cantrips (0-Level Spells)</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the <a style=\"color:#704cd9\" title=\"artificer spell list\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=252717\">artificer spell list</a>. At higher levels, you learn additional artificer cantrips of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Artificer table.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the artificer cantrips you know with another cantrip from the artificer spell list.</p>\n<h5 id=\"PreparingandCastingSpells\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Artificer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your artificer spells. To cast one of your artificer spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of artificer spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the <a style=\"color:#704cd9\" title=\"artificer spell list\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=252717\">artificer spell list</a>. When you do so, choose a number of artificer spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + half your artificer level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 5th-level artificer, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of artificer spells requires time spent tinkering with your spellcasting focuses: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Heading\"><strong>THE MAGIC OF ARTIFICE</strong></p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">As an artificer, you use tools when you cast your spells. When describing your spellcasting, think about how you’re using a tool to perform the spell effect. If you cast cure wounds using alchemist’s supplies, you could be quickly producing a salve. If you cast it using tinker’s tools, you might have a miniature mechanical spider that binds wounds. When you cast poison spray, you could fling foul chemicals or use a wand that spits venom. The effect of the spell is the same as for a spellcaster of any other class, but your method of spellcasting is special.</p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">The same principle applies when you prepare your spells. As an artificer, you don’t study a spellbook or pray to prepare your spells. Instead, you work with your tools and create the specialized items you’ll use to produce your effects. If you replace cure wounds with heat metal, you might be altering the device you use to heal—perhaps modifying a tool so that it channels heat instead of healing energy.</p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">Such details don’t limit you in any way or provide you with any benefit beyond the spell’s effects. You don’t have to justify how you’re using tools to cast a spell. But describing your spellcasting creatively is a fun way to distinguish yourself from other spellcasters.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h5 id=\"SpellcastingAbility\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your artificer spells; your understanding of the theory behind magic allows you to wield these spells with superior skill. You use your Intelligence whenever an artificer spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an artificer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered ParaOverride-2\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\n<h5 id=\"RitualCasting\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Ritual Casting</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast an artificer spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>\n\n<p><b>@Compendium[world.ddb-tengria-ddb-class-features.VArZYywGZ48AJXqd]{Infuse Item}</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 2nd level, you gain the ability to imbue mundane items with certain magical infusions. The magic items you create with this feature are effectively prototypes of permanent items.</p>\n<h5 id=\"InfusionsKnown\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Infusions Known</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you gain this feature, pick four artificer infusions to learn, choosing from the “<a title=\"Artificer Infusions\" href=\"#ArtificerInfusions-1131764\">Artificer Infusions</a>” section at the end of the class’s description. You learn additional infusions of your choice when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Infusions Known column of the <a title=\"Artificer table\" href=\"#TheArtificerTable\">Artificer table</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the artificer infusions you learned with a new one.</p>\n<h5 id=\"InfusinganItem\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Infusing an Item</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch a non-magical object and imbue it with one of your artificer infusions, turning it into a magic item. An infusion works on only certain kinds of objects, as specified in the infusion’s description. If the item requires attunement, you can attune yourself to it the instant you infuse the item. If you decide to attune to the item later, you must do so using the normal process for attunement (see “<a title=\"Attunement\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/treasure#Attunement\">Attunement</a>” in chapter 7 of the <em><a title=\"Dungeon Master’s Guide\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg\">Dungeon Master’s Guide</a></em>).</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Your infusion remains in an item indefinitely, but when you die, the infusion vanishes after a number of days have passed equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 day). The infusion also vanishes if you give up your knowledge of the infusion for another one.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can infuse more than one nonmagical object at the end of a long rest; the maximum number of objects appears in the Infused Items column of the <a title=\"Artificer table\" href=\"#TheArtificerTable\">Artificer table</a>. You must touch each of the objects, and each of your infusions can be in only one object at a time. Moreover, no object can bear more than one of your infusions at a time. If you try to exceed your maximum number of infusions, the oldest infusion immediately ends, and then the new infusion applies.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If an infusion ends on an item that contains other things, like a bag of holding, its contents harmlessly appear in and around its space.</p>\n\n<p><b>@Compendium[world.ddb-tengria-ddb-class-features.MKO1PJ4ppnYeOTwg]{Artificer Infusions}</b></p>\n<p>Artificer infusions are extraordinary processes that rapidly turn a nonmagical object into a magic item.</p>\n<p>The description of each of the following infusions details the type of object that can receive it, along with whether the resulting magic item requires attunement.</p>\n<p>Some infusions specify a minimum artificer level. You can’t learn such an infusion until you are at least that level.</p>\n<p>Unless an infusion’s description says otherwise, you can’t learn an infusion more than once.</p>\n<h5 id=\"ArcanePropulsionArmor\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Arcane Propulsion Armor</h5>\n<p><em>Prerequisite: 14th-level artificer<br />Item: A suit of armor (requires attunement)</em></p>\n<p>The wearer of this armor gains these benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The wearer’s walking speed increases by 5 feet.</li>\n<li>The armor includes gauntlets, each of which is a magic melee weapon that can be wielded only when the hand is holding nothing. The wearer is proficient with the gauntlets, and each one deals 1d8 force damage on a hit and has the thrown property, with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. When thrown, the gauntlet detaches and flies at the attack’s target, then immediately returns to the wearer and reattaches.</li>\n<li>The armor can’t be removed against the wearer’s will.</li>\n<li>If the wearer is missing any limbs, the armor replaces those limbs—hands, arms, feet, legs, or similar appendages. The replacements function identically to the body parts they replace.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5 id=\"ArmorofMagicalStrength\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Armor of Magical Strength</h5>\n<p><em>Item: A suit of armor (requires attunement)</em></p>\n<p>This armor has 6 charges. The wearer can expend the armor’s charges in the following ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When the wearer makes a Strength check or a Strength saving throw, it can expend 1 charge to add a bonus to the roll equal to its Intelligence modifier.</li>\n<li>If the creature would be knocked prone, it can use its reaction to expend 1 charge to avoid being knocked prone.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The armor regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn.</p>\n<h5 id=\"BootsoftheWindingPath\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Boots of the Winding Path</h5>\n<p><em>Prerequisite: 6th-level artificer<br />Item: A pair of boots (requires attunement)</em></p>\n<p>While wearing these boots, a creature can teleport up to 15 feet as a bonus action to an unoccupied space the creature can see. The creature must have occupied that space at some point during the current turn.</p>\n<h5 id=\"EnhancedArcaneFocus\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Enhanced Arcane Focus</h5>\n<p><em>Item: A rod, staff, or wand (requires attunement)</em></p>\n<p>While holding this item, a creature gains a +1 bonus to spell attack rolls. In addition, the creature ignores @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.6PfYpwxkdQkyS6b7.JournalEntryPage.kYIupxHL0v6kzLMq]{half cover} when making a spell attack.</p>\n<p>The bonus increases to +2 when you reach 10th level in this class.</p>\n<h5 id=\"EnhancedDefense\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Enhanced Defense</h5>\n<p><em>Item: A suit of armor or a shield</em></p>\n<p>A creature gains a +1 bonus to Armor Class while wearing (armor) or wielding (shield) the infused item.</p>\n<p>The bonus increases to +2 when you reach 10th level in this class.</p>\n<h5 id=\"EnhancedWeapon\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Enhanced Weapon</h5>\n<p><em>Item: A simple or martial weapon</em></p>\n<p>This magic weapon grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.</p>\n<p>The bonus increases to +2 when you reach 10th level in this class.</p>\n<h5 id=\"HelmofAwareness\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Helm of Awareness</h5>\n<p><em>Prerequisite: 10th-level artificer<br />Item: A helmet (requires attunement)</em></p>\n<p>While wearing this helmet, a creature has advantage on initiative rolls. In addition, the wearer can’t be surprise;surprised, provided it isn’t incapacitated.</p>\n<h5 id=\"HomunculusServant\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Homunculus Servant</h5>\n<p><em>Item: A gem or crystal worth at least 100 gp</em></p>\n<p>You learn intricate methods for magically creating a special homunculus that serves you. The item you infuse serves as the creature’s heart, around which the creature’s body instantly forms.</p>\n<p>You determine the homunculus’s appearance. Some artificers prefer mechanical-looking birds, whereas some like winged vials or miniature, animate cauldrons.</p>\n<p>The homunculus is friendly to you and your companions, and it obeys your commands. See this creature’s game statistics in the Homunculus Servant stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places.</p>\n<p>In combat, the homunculus shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, the homunculus can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.</p>\n<p>The homunculus regains 2d6 hit points if the mending spell is cast on it. If you or the homunculus dies, it vanishes, leaving its heart in its space.</p>\n<div class=\"Basic-Text-Frame stat-block-background\">\n<p class=\"Stat-Block-Styles_Stat-Block-Title\">Homunculus Servant</p>\n<p class=\"Stat-Block-Styles_Stat-Block-Metadata\">Tiny construct</p>\n<p class=\"Stat-Block-Styles_Stat-Block-Data\"><strong>Armor Class</strong> 13 (natural armor)</p>\n<p class=\"Stat-Block-Styles_Stat-Block-Data\"><strong>Hit Points </strong>1 + your Intelligence modifier + your artificer level (the homunculus has a number of Hit Dice [d4s] equal to your artificer level)</p>\n<p class=\"Stat-Block-Styles_Stat-Block-Data\"><strong>Speed </strong>20 ft., fly 30 ft.</p>\n<div class=\"stat-block-ability-scores\">\n<div class=\"stat-block-ability-scores-stat\">\n<div class=\"stat-block-ability-scores-heading\">STR</div>\n<div class=\"stat-block-ability-scores-data\"><span class=\"stat-block-ability-scores-score\">4</span> <span class=\"stat-block-ability-scores-modifier\">(−3)</span></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"stat-block-ability-scores-stat\">\n<div class=\"stat-block-ability-scores-heading\">DEX</div>\n<div class=\"stat-block-ability-scores-data\"><span class=\"stat-block-ability-scores-score\">15</span> <span class=\"stat-block-ability-scores-modifier\">(+2)</span></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"stat-block-ability-scores-stat\">\n<div class=\"stat-block-ability-scores-heading\">CON</div>\n<div class=\"stat-block-ability-scores-data\"><span class=\"stat-block-ability-scores-score\">12</span> <span class=\"stat-block-ability-scores-modifier\">(+1)</span></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"stat-block-ability-scores-stat\">\n<div class=\"stat-block-ability-scores-heading\">INT</div>\n<div class=\"stat-block-ability-scores-data\"><span class=\"stat-block-ability-scores-score\">10</span> <span class=\"stat-block-ability-scores-modifier\">(+0)</span></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"stat-block-ability-scores-stat\">\n<div class=\"stat-block-ability-scores-heading\">WIS</div>\n<div class=\"stat-block-ability-scores-data\"><span class=\"stat-block-ability-scores-score\">10</span> <span class=\"stat-block-ability-scores-modifier\">(+0)</span></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"stat-block-ability-scores-stat\">\n<div class=\"stat-block-ability-scores-heading\">CHA</div>\n<div class=\"stat-block-ability-scores-data\"><span class=\"stat-block-ability-scores-score\">7</span> <span class=\"stat-block-ability-scores-modifier\">(−2)</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p class=\"Stat-Block-Styles_Stat-Block-Data\"><strong>Saving Throws </strong>Dex +2 plus PB</p>\n<p class=\"Stat-Block-Styles_Stat-Block-Data\"><strong>Skills</strong> Perception +0 plus PB × 2, Stealth +2 plus PB</p>\n<p class=\"Stat-Block-Styles_Stat-Block-Data\"><strong>Damage Immunities</strong> poison</p>\n<p class=\"Stat-Block-Styles_Stat-Block-Data\"><strong>Condition Immunities</strong> exhaustion, poisoned</p>\n<p class=\"Stat-Block-Styles_Stat-Block-Data\"><strong>Senses </strong>darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 10 + (PB × 2)</p>\n<p class=\"Stat-Block-Styles_Stat-Block-Data\"><strong>Languages </strong>understands the languages you speak</p>\n<p class=\"Stat-Block-Styles_Stat-Block-Data-Last\"><strong>Challenge</strong> — <strong>Proficiency Bonus (PB)</strong> equals your bonus</p>\n<p class=\"Stat-Block-Styles_Stat-Block-Body\"><em><strong>Evasion.</strong></em> If the homunculus is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.

To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">cure wounds</span>, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability.

Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving.

When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed.

Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s shape and size.

In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a paladin spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Focus</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use a holy symbol (see the <span style=\"color:#47d18c\"><a style=\"color:#47d18c\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#HolySymbol\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your paladin spells.</p>\n\n<p><b>@Compendium[world.ddb-tengria-ddb-class-features.BFei6GxBDngkmjZD]{Divine Smite}</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon’s damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an undead or a fiend, to a maximum of 6d8.</p>\n\n<p><b>@Compendium[world.ddb-tengria-ddb-class-features.YrLewiXAIZIlt1ao]{Divine Health}</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">By 3rd level, the divine magic flowing through you makes you immune to disease.</p>\n\n<p><b>@Compendium[world.ddb-tengria-ddb-class-features.ZLhDtAIiS71BFetr]{Sacred Oath}</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you reach 3rd level, you swear the oath that binds you as a paladin forever. Up to this time you have been in a preparatory stage, committed to the path but not yet sworn to it. Now you choose the Oath of Devotion detailed at the end of the class description or one from another source.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level. Those features include oath spells and the Channel Divinity feature.</p>\n<h4 class=\"compendium-hr\">Oath Spells</h4>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Each oath has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these spells at the levels specified in the oath description. Once you gain access to an oath spell, you always have it prepared. Oath spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If you gain an oath spell that doesn’t appear on the paladin spell list, the spell is nonetheless a paladin spell for you.</p>\n<h4 class=\"compendium-hr\">Channel Divinity</h4>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Your oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. Each Channel Divinity option provided by your oath explains how to use it.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your paladin spell save DC.</p>\n\n<p><b>@Compendium[world.ddb-tengria-ddb-class-features.hgQgLpvQFhJi7tUl]{Ability Score Improvement}</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.

See <span style=\"color:#99cc00\"><a style=\"color:#47d18c\" title=\"Spells Rules\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/spellcasting\">Spells Rules</a></span> for the general rules of spellcasting and the <span style=\"color:#993366\"><a style=\"color:#704cd9\" title=\"Spells Listing (Wizard)\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=8&amp;filter-search=&amp;filter-sub-class=&amp;filter-concentration=&amp;filter-ritual=&amp;filter-unlocked-content=\">Spells Listing</a></span> for the wizard spell list.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Cantrips</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellbook</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you’re a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">magic missile,</span> you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered ParaOverride-2\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Ritual Casting</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don’t need to have the spell prepared.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Focus</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use an arcane focus (see the <span style=\"color:#47d18c\"><a style=\"color:#47d18c\" title=\"Adventuring Gear\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#ArcaneFocus\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the “Your Spellbook” sidebar).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Heading\"><strong>YOUR SPELLBOOK</strong></p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{nature} of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard’s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">Copying a Spell into the Book.</span></strong> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">Replacing the Book.</span></strong> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">The Book’s Appearance.</span></strong> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><b>@Compendium[world.ddb-tengria-ddb-class-features.t8H06sLzx3EuoNwr]{Arcane Recovery}</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you’re a 4th-level wizard, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots.</p>\n\n<p><b>Proficiencies</b></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Armor:</span></strong> None<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Weapons: </span></strong>Daggers, darts, slings, quarterstaffs, light crossbows<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Tools: </span></strong>None<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Saving Throws: </span></strong>Intelligence, Wisdom<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Skills: </span></strong>Choose two from @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{Arcana}, @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{History}, @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{Insight}, @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{Investigation}, @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{Medicine}, and @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{Religion}</p>\n\n<p><b>Hit Points</b></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Dice: </span></strong>1d6 per wizard level<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Points at 1st Level: </span></strong>6 + your Constitution modifier<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Points at Higher Levels: </span></strong>1d6 (or 4) + your Constitution modifier per wizard level after 1st</p>\n\n<p><b>@Compendium[world.ddb-tengria-ddb-class-features.lFr8oL2HcvdoH0NW]{Arcane Tradition}</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane tradition, shaping your practice of magic through one of eight schools: Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy, or Transmutation.

Choose a 1st-level wizard spell and a 2nd-level wizard spell that are in your spellbook. You can cast those spells at their lowest level without expending a spell slot when you have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the spells you chose for different spells of the same levels.</p>\n\n<p><b>@Compendium[world.ddb-tengria-ddb-class-features.qGzmrAmIEslagsT7]{Signature Spells}</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful spells and can cast them with little effort. Choose two 3rd-level wizard spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, they don’t count against the number of spells you have prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 3rd level without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.</p>"
